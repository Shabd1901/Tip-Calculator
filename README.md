# 💰 Day 2 – Tip Calculator & Python Basics Practice

This repository contains all my code from **Day 2** of [Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

## 🚀 Main Project: Tip Calculator

The highlight of Day 2 is the **Tip Calculator** project.

📄 **File**: `PROJECT - Tip Calculator.py`

🔹 **What it does**:
- Calculates how much each person should pay after splitting a bill
- Takes into account the tip percentage
- Uses rounding, f-strings, and arithmetic logic

## 🧠 Practice Files

In addition to the project, I also practiced several core Python concepts:

### ✅ Topics Covered:
- Data types and type conversion
- String manipulation
- Arithmetic operations
- Number rounding and formatting
- Floor division
- BMI Calculator

### 📄 Files:
- `Data Types.py`
- `Typing.py`
- `Task.py` _(associated with Typing.py)_
- `Mathematical conversion in python.py`
- `EXERCISE - BMI Calculator.py`
- `Number Manipulation.py`
